## Creating a TI Datamath 2500 Calculator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS

## The Datamath was presented as one of the most iconic calculators according to PCMag.com

### "The Datamath 2500 was Texas Instruments's first pocket calculator, and one of the smallest calculators on the market at the time of its release. It was about the size of a pack of 100s cigarettes in length and about 1.5 packs in thickness. It sold for $119.95 at launch -- about $640 today when adjusted for inflation -- which was actually relatively inexpensive for a calculator at the time. It sold well and set the stage for TI's successful future in the calculator market."
